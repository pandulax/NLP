11100050-2200050Request>26>BB>) Total sum of Fifteen Million, Seven Hundred and Forty Five Thousand British Pounds (15,745,000.00)GBP was invested on behalf of the late president of LIBYA under a SECRET CODE INVESTMENT where none of his personal informations was used for the investment. This is known between only both of us and not even the investment company has informations about the owner of the investment. Now that President Muammar Gaddafi is DEAD,I need a reliable and trustworthy person with whom I can work this deal out so that we can claim the funds as mentioned above. There is no risk attached and the funds in question can never be dictated or traced.
